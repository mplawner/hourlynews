Why?
I was trying to keep up with the overwhelming amount of information being published in Telegram channels.
It was coming fast, and in Hebrew. My phone, my watch, my computer were all buzzing all the time. It was too much!
I wrote a script to aggreagate the various news feeds every hour, and use OpenAI to write a consoldated report.
And then, my inner nerd took over and...
I had it read it to me from the little speaker on the Raspberry Pi 3b it's running on...
Then posted it to a Telegram channel...
Then added music and published it as a podcast...
Then started distributing it on Mastodon...

I welcome any contributions!
